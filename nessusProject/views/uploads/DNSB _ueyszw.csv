unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

    request parameter can be used to access potentially
    sensitive configuration files or other files, e.g.,
    files in the WEB-INF directory. (CVE-2008-5515)

    vulnerability if configured to use the Java AJP
    connector. An attacker can send a malicious request with
    invalid headers which causes the AJP connector to be put
    into an error state for a short time. This behavior can
    be used as a denial of service attack. (CVE-2009-0033)

    vulnerability if configured to use FORM authentication
    along with the 'MemoryRealm', 'DataSourceRealm', or
    'JDBCRealm' authentication realms. (CVE-2009-0580)

  - The remote server is affected by a script injection
    vulnerability if the example JSP application,
    'cal2.jsp', is installed. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this issue to inject arbitrary HTML
    or script code into a user's browser to be executed
    within the security context of the affected site.

    for the use of quotes or '%5C' in cookie values.

    access and write arbitrary files in the context of the
    Tomcat process. (CVE-2007-5342)

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause

vulnerabilities.","According to its self-reported version number, the Apache Tomcat
service listening on the remote host is 6.0.x prior to 6.0.44. It is,
therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An error exists due to a failure to limit the size of
    discarded requests. A remote attacker can exploit this
    to exhaust available memory resources, resulting in a
    denial of service condition. (CVE-2014-0230)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A malicious application can use expression language to
    bypass the internal Security Manager and execute code
    with elevated privileges. (CVE-2014-7810)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client
    authentication without the CertificateVerify message.
    This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the
    service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)

  - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()
    when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing
    the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This
    allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0206)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper

    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

vulnerabilities.","According to its self-reported version number, the Apache Tomcat
service listening on the remote host is 6.0.x prior to 6.0.44. It is,
therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An error exists due to a failure to limit the size of
    discarded requests. A remote attacker can exploit this
    to exhaust available memory resources, resulting in a
    denial of service condition. (CVE-2014-0230)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3
    option isn't enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is
    received. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in
    a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)

  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not
    properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This
    allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with
    dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote
    attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)

  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA
    certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This
    allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward
    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A malicious application can use expression language to
    bypass the internal Security Manager and execute code
    with elevated privileges. (CVE-2014-7810)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client
    authentication without the CertificateVerify message.
    This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the
    service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)

  - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()
    when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing
    the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This
    allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

    secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)

  - A malicious application can use expression language to
    bypass the internal Security Manager and execute code
    with elevated privileges. (CVE-2014-7810)

  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of
    certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings
    due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed
    and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including
    crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,
    can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist
    protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)

  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK
    (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the
    support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less
    than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker
    may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use
    EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a
    short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept
    and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)

  - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client
    authentication without the CertificateVerify message.
    This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the
    service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)

  - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()
    when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing
    the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This
    allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0206)

  - A use-after-free condition exists in the
    d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing
    of malformed EC private key files during import. A
    remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free
    already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service
    or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)

  - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()
    function due to improperly performed boolean-type
    comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the
    certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid
    read operation, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2015-0286)

  - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to
    a failure to reinitialize 'CHOICE' and 'ADB' data
    structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.
    This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write
    operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial
    of service. (CVE-2015-0287)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing
    of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via
    a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of
    service. (CVE-2015-0288)

  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7
    parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer
    ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an
    application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and
    providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)

  - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and
    enable export cipher suites due to improper
    implementation of SSLv2. A remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a crafted CLIENT-MASTER-KEY message, to cause
    a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0293)

therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    getResource(), getResourceAsStream(), and
    getResourcePaths() ServletContext methods due to a
    failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a
    crafted path traversal request, to gain access to the
    listing of directory contents. (CVE-2015-5174)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to
    a failure to enforce access restrictions when handling
    directory requests that are missing trailing slashes. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    enumerate valid directories. (CVE-2015-5345)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists that
    allows a specially crafted web application to load the
    StatusManagerServlet. An attacker can exploit this to
    gain unauthorized access to a list of all deployed
    applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for
    all requests currently being processed. (CVE-2016-0706)

  - A security bypass vulnerability exists due to a flaw
    in the StandardManager, PersistentManager, and cluster
    implementations that is triggered when handling
    persistent sessions. An unauthenticated, remote attacker
    can exploit this, via a crafted object in a session, to

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

however, no credentials were provided in the scan policy.","Nessus was not able to successfully authenticate directly to the
remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was
able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service
running on the port supports an authentication protocol, but Nessus
failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided
credentials. There may have been a protocol failure that prevented
authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials
for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for
error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to
collision attacks. An attacker can exploit this to generate another
certificate with the same digital signature, allowing an attacker to
masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with
SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in
accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic
hash algorithm.

CA database (known_CA.inc) have been ignored.","Contact the Certificate Authority to have the SSL certificate reissued.","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not

  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

    vulnerability if configured to use FORM authentication
    along with the 'MemoryRealm', 'DataSourceRealm', or

  - The remote server is affected by a script injection
    vulnerability if the example JSP application,
    'cal2.jsp', is installed. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this issue to inject arbitrary HTML
    or script code into a user's browser to be executed

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

    'quality of protection' (qop) values are not checked,
    realm values are not checked and the server secret is

  - An input validation error exists that allows a local
    attacker to either bypass security or carry out denial
    of service attacks when the APR or NIO connectors are
    enabled. (CVE-2011-2526)

  - A component that Apache Tomcat relies on called 'jsvc'
    contains an error in that it does not drop capabilities
    after starting and can allow access to sensitive files
    owned by the super user. Note this vulnerability only
    affects Linux operating systems and only when 'jsvc' is
    compiled with libpcap and the '-user' parameter is
    used. (CVE-2011-2729)

  - Specially crafted requests are incorrectly processed by
    Tomcat and can cause the server to allow injection of
    arbitrary AJP messages. This can lead to authentication
    bypass and disclosure of sensitive information. Note
